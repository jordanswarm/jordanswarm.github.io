# Hi!

My name is Jordan Swarm and I am a junior at the University of Maryland pursuing a degree in journalism. I am a staff writer for the Maryland chapter of Her Campus and have written for The Diamondback. Upon graduation I am interested in pursuing a career in magazine writing as well as photojournalism or visual storytelling. I am based in Silver Spring, Maryland. If you have any questions about freelance work or the photos on my website my email is jordanswarm17@gmail.com.
