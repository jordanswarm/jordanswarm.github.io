# Zoomerz

Cooper Poe and his friends have let their love of cars become a way to solidify them as a group. They identify both as “Zoomerz” and “Rowdy Boys” with merchandise and a couple of tattoos to prove it. With avoidance of traffic laws and general mayhem being their specialty, the Zoomerz epitomize young local car culture. Their cars range from new to old, but the group has a special place in their heart for 90’s cars, and the lower they ride the better.
